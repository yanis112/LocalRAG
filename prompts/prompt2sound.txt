Here is an image description for a text-to-image generation model given by a user, in the intent to generate a movie/film still: <prompt_start> {prompt} <prompt_end>. Based on this description, you will make a prompt for an image-to-sound generation model. The goal of this model is to generate a cinematic sound that would fit the scene described in the image. The prompt should be very concise, precising the type of sound that fits the scene. The prompt should be only one short sentence. Answer the prompt without preamble.
