Your task is to determine the next web interaction for a web automation agent.

Consider the following:

Global Objective, what the user wants to achieve (for the current sub-task): {global_objective}
OmniParser Output (detailed analysis of the current web page state and components): {omni_parser_output}
Previous Actions (history of executed actions): {previous_actions}
Allowed Actions (available tool calls with required parameters): {action_dict}

Based on the above, generate an appropriate tool call the agent should execute next.
