  * Sidebar content (related articles, ads, widgets)
  * Advertisements and promotional content
  * User interface elements (buttons, forms, search bars, dropdowns) *unless they are directly embedded within the main content being preserved*
  * Script tags and style tags (`<script>`, `<style>`)
  * Irrelevant metadata (timestamps, author information *if separate from the main body*)
  * Comments sections
  * Social media sharing buttons and embeds
  * Cookie consent banners
  * Pop-ups and overlays
  * Any content clearly not part of the main article or information being conveyed.
