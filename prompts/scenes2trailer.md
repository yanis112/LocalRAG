1. **Order the scenes** in a way that creates a compelling and coherent narrative for a blockbuster movie trailer.
2. **Define the start and end times** for each scene on the `video_track`, ensuring each clip is 5 seconds long.
3. **Describe the overall music** for the trailer in the `music_track`, specifying instruments, tempo, and mood.
4. **Write the narrator's lines** in the `narrator_track`, ensuring they are relevant to the project description and the chosen scene order. Provide a description of the narrator's voice. Specify the start and end times for each line.
5. **Add character voices** in the `character_voices_track` if needed, describing each character and their voice, and providing their lines with start and end times.
6. **Add relevant sound effects** in the `sound_effects_track`, describing each effect and specifying its start and end times.
7. **Fill** the "trailer_title" field in the JSON Object with a title for the trailer.
