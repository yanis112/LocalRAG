Given this website screenshot and the following global web search objective: {global_objective},
give the most probable unitary action to take to reach the objective in the current state (screenshot). Pay attention 
to the fact that the good action depends on the current state and the previous actions taken for exemple if login ids and passwords
are already written you can click on login button, but not if they are not written. Here is the list of previous actions taken: {previous_actions}.
You can choose from the following list of actions: {action_dict}. You must answer in the following 
json/dict format:  {{"function": {{"name": "get_weather","arguments": {{"city": "New York"}}}}}} or
in our case {{"function": {{"name": "click","arguments": {{"element": "search_button"}}}}}} or {{"function": {{"name": "write","arguments": {{"text": "username","into": "Username"}}}}}}.
Answer the json/dict format without preamble.
