### Post-Production Visual Effects

1. **Color Grading**: The process of altering or enhancing the color of an image in post-production to create a specific mood or atmosphere.
2. **LUTs (Look-Up Tables)**: Tools used in post-production to apply a specific color transformation, giving an image a distinctive look, often predefined.
3. **Cinematic Filters**: Special filters applied in post-production to add a cinematic quality to images, giving them a more polished and professional feel.
4. **Digital Intermediate (DI)**: A digital post-production process used to manipulate the color and image quality of a movie after it has been shot.

### Cinematic Enhancements

1. **Lens Flares**: An effect that simulates light scattering inside a camera lens, often used to add a more cinematic feel to an image.
2. **Light Leaks**: Effects that simulate light entering the camera unintentionally, creating artistic halos or bursts of light across the image.

### Atmospheric Effects

1. **Particle Systems**: Digital effects used to simulate tiny particles like dust, smoke, or sparks to add atmosphere and depth to a scene.
2. **Volumetric Lighting**: A technique that makes light rays visible, often used to create "god rays" in misty or dusty environments.

### Compositing

1. **Compositing**: The process of combining multiple visual elements into a single cohesive image, blending effects like light leaks, lens flares, and particle systems into the scene.

### Cinematic Look

The term "**cinematic look**" refers to the overall aesthetic created through these post-production effects, helping transform an ordinary shot into something visually stunning and dynamic.
