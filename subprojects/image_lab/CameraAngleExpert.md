### Camera Angles & Cinematography

1. **Establishing Shot**: A wide-angle shot showing the entire scene, often used to introduce a setting or location. It provides context by presenting the environment where the action will take place.

2. **Aerial Shot**: A bird‚Äôs-eye view taken from a high vantage point (e.g., drone or helicopter), giving a broad perspective on a landscape or cityscape. This angle emphasizes scale and grandeur.

3. **Dutch Angle**: A tilted or slanted camera angle that creates a feeling of unease, tension, or instability. It's often used to convey disorientation or psychological unease in a scene.

4. **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**: A highly detailed shot that focuses on a very small part of the subject, like a character's eyes, hands, or an object. This angle is used to highlight significant emotional or narrative details.

5. **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**: A shot taken from behind a character, typically framing another character or subject in front. Often used in dialogue scenes to provide perspective from one character‚Äôs point of view.

6. **Point-of-View (POV)**: A shot that shows what a specific character sees, offering a direct representation of their perspective. It immerses the viewer in the character's experience.

7. **Wide Shot**: Also known as a "long shot," this captures the full subject in relation to their environment, offering context while keeping the focus on the character or action.

8. **Medium Shot**: A camera angle that typically frames the subject from the waist up, providing a balance between character detail and background context. This angle is often used in dialogues or character interactions.

9. **High Angle Shot**: A shot taken from above the subject, making them appear smaller and possibly more vulnerable or insignificant. It alters the power dynamics within the frame.

10. **Low Angle Shot**: A shot taken from below the subject, making them appear larger, more imposing, or powerful. It‚Äôs often used to emphasize dominance or strength.

11. **Eye-Level Shot**: A neutral shot taken at the subject's eye level, creating a sense of equality between the viewer and the subject. It provides a straightforward, natural perspective.

12. **Close-Up**: A shot that tightly frames a person or object, often used to capture emotional expressions or significant details. This angle focuses on the face or a specific part of the subject.

13. **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**: A shot that shows a vast environment, often with the subject very small in the frame. It emphasizes scale and can isolate the subject within a large or overwhelming setting.

14. **Two-Shot**: A composition that includes two characters in the same frame, typically used to show their relationship or interaction.

15. **Profile Shot**: A shot where the subject is viewed from the side, highlighting their profile. It can be used for both character-focused moments or to emphasize a subject's stance.

16. **Overhead Shot**: Also known as a "top-down shot," this captures the scene from directly above, offering a unique, often detached perspective.

17. **Tilted Up or Down Shot**: A static shot where the camera is positioned higher or lower than the subject, but without movement. Tilted up emphasizes power or dominance, while tilted down can create vulnerability.

18. **Full Shot**: A shot that frames a character from head to toe, showing the entire figure and sometimes their immediate surroundings. It‚Äôs used to provide full context of the subject in relation to the setting.

19. **Reverse Angle**: A shot taken from the opposite side of a previous shot, often used in dialogue or action sequences to show the opposite perspective of a character or object.

### WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è: We want to create static images so don't use any camera movements like zooming, panning, or tilting, or switches between different camaera angles. The focus should be on the composition and framing of the shot.
